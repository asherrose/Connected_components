# Connected_components
Implements a 4-connected connected component algorithm
I. Input: A binary image.
	     C++ in argv[1] 
	     Java in argv[0] 
II. Outputs: 

   (a) outFile1:   in argv[2] in C++ and Java argv[1] Java for:
  
	 1) Pretty print the result of the Pass-1 and the EQAry with proper captions
	 2) Pretty print the result of the Pass-2 and the EQAry with proper captions
	 3) print EQAry after manage the EQAry 
	 4) Pretty print the result of the Pass-3 and the EQAry with proper caption

   (b) outFile2:   in argv[3] in C++ and Java in argv[2] for:
 
	 5) create an image file from the result of Pass-3 with header for
		future processing.

   (c) outFile3: in argv[4] in C++ and argv[3] in Java for:
	 (6) Output the connected component property using the format given below
 				// print the header of the CC image, follows by the 
				// The numbers of the c.c. follows by the properties of 
				// each c.c. components.
